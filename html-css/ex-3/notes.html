        <div class="section">
            <h2>Approach to the Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The exercise seemed simple enough at first. The goal was to create a blog post and style it using basic HTML and CSS. My approach was to break down the task into logical steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with a simple HTML structure, adding a title and subtitle to the blog post.</li>
                <li>Then, work on styling the content using CSS, focusing on alignment and margins.</li>
                <li>For the next level, I needed to add a list, a blockquote, and an inline code snippet, ensuring that each element was styled properly using CSS element selectors.</li>
                <li>For the final step, I planned to use a classless CSS framework to enhance the design of the blog post, experimenting with different options like Classless.de to keep it minimalistic yet visually appealing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Questions and Responses</h2>

            <p><span class="question">Question 1:</span> How can I center-align the content of my blog post and apply basic margins using classless CSS?</p>
            <p class="response">GPT suggested using basic CSS properties like `text-align: center` for centering and adding some padding and margins to the `main` element to give the content some space from the edges. I also highlighted how this could be enhanced using a framework like Classless.de for a minimalist design.</p>

            <p><span class="question">Question 2:</span> How can I add a list, blockquote, and an inline code snippet to the blog post and style them using element selectors?</p>
            <p class="response">GPT explained how to semantically structure the HTML for these elements and provided basic CSS for styling. For the blockquote, GPT suggested using italics, adding a border, and setting a background color for better visual emphasis. For the list, GPT recommended using `list-style-type` for custom bullets, and for the inline code, it suggested using a monospace font and a background color to highlight it.</p>

            <p><span class="question">Question 3:</span> How can I enhance with Classless.de</p>
            <p class="response">GPT said its a minimalist framework that doesn't rely on classes or IDs for styling. It pointed out that using such a framework would allow me to keep things simple while still benefiting from a clean, consistent design. GPT recommended experimenting with the framework to see how its default styles impact the overall design and making adjustments as necessary.</p>

            <p><span class="question">Question 4:</span> Can you review my approach and code to ensure everything is correctly implemented?</p>
            <p class="response">GPT reviewed my code, and  praised my structured approach. I successfully broke down each level of the assignment and implemented all the required elements. gpt made a few suggestions to enhance readability, like adjusting the contrast for certain text and tweaking some styling for finer control.GPT also encouraged you to experiment further with responsiveness and custom styles for additional control over the design.</p>
