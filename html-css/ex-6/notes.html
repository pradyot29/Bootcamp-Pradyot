    <h1>Notes for Exercise 6</h1>
    <p>
        In this exercise, I set up daily.dev as our homepage to follow relevant articles and updates on web development. I subscribed to several popular newsletters like JavaScript Weekly, CSS Weekly, and This Week in React to receive curated content. Additionally, I read annual reports such as State of JS, State of CSS, and State of Frontend to get an overview of current industry trends. Lastly, I subscribed to 5 YouTube channels from popular developers in the ecosystem to further enhance my knowledge through video tutorials and practical content.
