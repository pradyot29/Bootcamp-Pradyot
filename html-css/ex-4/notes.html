    <h1>CSS Units & Responsive Design: Thought Process</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>My Thought Process</h2>
        <p>
            I started by learning about different CSS units like px, em, rem, vh, vw, and how they affect layout design. 
            I realized that some units are fixed (like px), while others like em and rem are relative and better for scalability.
            I wanted to understand how to use these units to create a layout that could scale dynamically across different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, I aimed to center the content on the page. I figured that using Flexbox was an easy way to do this because it allows the content to be aligned both vertically and horizontally without needing complex calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then needed to make the font sizes and content block sizes scale fluidly as the screen size changes. This is where I explored <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>clamp()</code> to ensure that font sizes and block widths could scale proportionally within a range.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next challenge was to create continuous responsiveness without relying on fixed breakpoints. I wanted a more fluid experience, where the design responds to screen size changes smoothly. That's when I looked into using units like vh, vw, and CSS functions like clamp().

        <h2>Questions I Asked</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Q1:</strong> "How do different CSS units like px, em, rem, vh, vw, etc., impact responsive design?"</li>
            <p>Response: I understood that px is fixed and doesn't scale well with screen sizes. em and rem are relative, making them better suited for responsiveness. Units like vh and vw scale with the viewport, making them ideal for fluid layouts.</p>

            <li><strong>Q2:</strong> "How do I center a content block horizontally and vertically on the page?"</li>
            <p>Response: Using Flexbox in the body tag helped me center the content both horizontally and vertically. I set the body's height to 100vh and used <code>justify-content: center</code> and <code>align-items: center</code> to achieve perfect centering.</p>

            <li><strong>Q3:</strong> "How can I use <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>clamp()</code> to scale text and content sizes?"</li>
            <p>Response: I used <code>clamp()</code> to set minimum and maximum values for font sizes and widths. For example, <code>font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3rem)</code> scaled the font between 1.5rem and 3rem based on viewport width, providing smooth scaling.</p>

            <li><strong>Q4:</strong> "What are continuous responsiveness techniques, and how can I avoid fixed breakpoints?"</li>
            <p>Response: Instead of using fixed breakpoints, I focused on fluid techniques like using <code>clamp()</code> for scaling and viewport units like vw and vh. These techniques ensured the layout scaled smoothly without needing fixed breakpoints.</p>

            <li><strong>Q5:</strong> "What are advanced responsive design techniques?"</li>
            <p>Response: I explored flexible grids and fluid typography. Flexible grids allow content to adjust naturally to different screen sizes, and fluid typography ensures that text scales properly for readability across devices.</p>
        </ul>
