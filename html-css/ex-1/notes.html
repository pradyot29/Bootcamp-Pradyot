    <h1>Thought Process for Exercise 1</h1>

    <h2>Level 1: Semantic HTML and Structure</h2>
    <p>During the first part of this exercise, I focused on using semantic HTML elements to structure the page. One of the questions I had was, "Why should I use semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements?" I learned that semantic tags help make the page more readable for both humans and search engines, which improves SEO and accessibility.</p>
    <p>Another question that came up was, "How do I structure my page using <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to separate different parts of content?" Using these elements, I was able to create a clean, understandable layout that made sense both for users and for any future development.</p>

    <h2>Level 2: Layout and Styling</h2>
    <p>When implementing the golden layout structure with two sidebars and a main content area, I asked myself, "How can I ensure that my layout works well across different screen sizes?" This led me to use a combination of <code>CSS Grid</code> and <code>Flexbox</code>. I used Grid to create a responsive layout for larger screens and Flexbox for smaller devices, ensuring the layout adapts without breaking.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I wondered, "How do I create a simple navigation menu inside my sidebars?" I used <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and styled the links inside it to make the menu clear and easy to navigate.</p>

    <h2>Level 3: Adding Content and Optimizing</h2>
    <p>As I added content, I started considering, "How do I ensure that my images are accessible?" I added <code>alt</code> text to the image elements to improve accessibility, making sure that users with visual impairments could understand the content. I also wondered, "How can I ensure that my table looks clean and readable?" I used <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> for header cells and styled the table to make it more user-friendly.</p>
    <p>Finally, I thought about, "How can I improve the readability of my text and content?" I made sure to structure paragraphs and content logically so that users could easily scan through the page. I also used clear headings to guide the user through different sections of the page.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This exercise helped me understand the importance of structuring HTML elements semantically for both accessibility and SEO. I learned how using proper tags like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> can make the page more understandable and user-friendly. I also learned how to create a balanced and responsive layout using Grid and Flexbox, ensuring the page adapts to different screen sizes.</p>
    <p>Overall, the exercise emphasized how small details like accessible images, well-structured tables, and logical content organization can make a big difference in the quality of a web page.</p>
