        <h1>Exercise 3: Basics of Icons</h1>

        <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
        <p>
            Icons seemed easy at first, but styling them and making everything look <strong>consistent</strong> was surprisingly difficult.  
            My first attempt at adding icons using <span class="highlight">Font Awesome</span> worked fine for Level 1, but by the time I reached Level 3, things started falling apart.  
            The alignment was messy, spacing felt uneven, and my navigation bar didn’t look professional.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Working with SVGs was also tricky. I struggled to combine inline SVGs with icons from the library while maintaining a clean layout. Hover effects were functional, but the animations felt <span class="highlight">awkward</span>.  
        </p>

        <h2>Tools and Resources Used:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Font Awesome for icon fonts</li>
            <li>Inline SVG files for custom icons</li>
            <li>CSS for icon styling, hover effects, and layout</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Thought Process:</h2>
        <p>
            I started with the basics—adding three icons using Font Awesome. It worked smoothly, and I could size and color them using CSS.  
            For Level 2, I explored inline SVGs, which gave me more flexibility but also introduced <span class="highlight">layout issues</span>. Mixing font-based icons and SVGs in the grid required extra effort to ensure they looked uniform.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Level 3 was the real challenge. Designing a navigation bar with icons as the main elements sounded simple, but I underestimated the alignment struggles.  
            I tried to position icons and text labels using CSS, but the spacing wasn’t consistent, and the overall look felt unpolished.  
            For buttons with embedded SVGs, I managed to get the icons to display, but aligning them within the buttons didn’t come out as clean as I wanted.
        </p>

        <h2>Specific Challenges:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Combining inline SVG icons with Font Awesome icons in a <strong>uniform layout</strong>.</li>
            <li>Creating hover effects that were smooth and visually appealing.</li>
            <li>Aligning icons and labels in the navigation bar properly.</li>
            <li>Ensuring consistent spacing between grid items and buttons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Learning Outcomes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How to use icon libraries like Font Awesome and style icons with CSS.</li>
            <li>Basic implementation of inline SVGs for custom icons.</li>
            <li>Understanding the importance of <strong>consistent spacing</strong> and alignment for better design.</li>
            <li>Experimenting with hover effects to add interactivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Could Be Improved:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Better alignment and spacing of icons, especially in the navigation bar.</li>
            <li>Smoother and more visually appealing hover effects.</li>
            <li>Improved consistency between font-based and SVG icons.</li>
            <li>Using a more structured approach to grid layouts for uniformity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <p>
            This exercise was a <span class="highlight">reality check</span> for me. I realized that even something as small as icons can make or break the overall design.  
            While I managed to complete all levels, I wasn’t happy with how the navigation bar and buttons turned out. I definitely need to focus more on alignment and spacing.  
            Moving forward, I’ll explore frameworks like Flexbox or Grid to handle layouts better and pay closer attention to design details.  
        </p>
        <p>
            On a positive note, working with SVGs gave me a better understanding of their flexibility, and Font Awesome was a great tool to learn icon styling.  
            Overall, I’ve identified areas for improvement and feel motivated to keep practicing!
