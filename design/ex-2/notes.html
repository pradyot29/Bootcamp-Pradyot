        <h1>Exercise 2: Basics of Colors</h1>
        
        <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
        <p>
            Diving into color theory felt overwhelming initially—balancing <strong>contrast</strong> and <strong>visual harmony</strong> was trickier than I thought. 
            My first attempt at a monochromatic theme looked bland, while complementary schemes often clashed too much.  
            Also, switching between dark and light themes using CSS variables was <span class="highlight">challenging</span> because small tweaks would disrupt the overall design.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools and Resources Used:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 for structure</li>
            <li>CSS Variables for dynamic color theming</li>
            <li>HSL values for fine-tuning color shades and saturation</li>
            <li>Developer Tools to test color contrast and readability</li>
            <li>Media Queries for responsive color palettes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Thought Process:</h2>
        <p>
            I started by experimenting with a <strong>monochromatic scheme</strong>—using a single base color and playing with opacity to make the card stand out. 
            Then I moved to a <strong>complementary color palette</strong>, trying to strike a balance between contrast and aesthetics. Adding an <strong>accent color</strong> for buttons and headers gave the page a nice finishing touch.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Level 2, I set up <strong>CSS variables</strong> to manage dark and light themes. Switching between them exposed issues with <strong>text contrast</strong> over images, so I had to fine-tune overlays for better readability.  
            Generating a color swatch grid with HSL was fun but required careful adjustments to maintain consistency.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Approaches:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Used <strong>CSS variables</strong> for flexible theming.</li>
            <li>Leveraged the <strong>HSL color model</strong> for smooth adjustments in lightness and saturation.</li>
            <li>Implemented <strong>media queries</strong> for responsive color palettes.</li>
            <li>Experimented with <strong>gradients</strong> for Level 3—linear for headers, radial for buttons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Learning Outcomes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How to create and balance monochromatic, complementary, and accent color schemes.</li>
            <li>Practical use of CSS variables to toggle between <strong>dark</strong> and <strong>light</strong> themes.</li>
            <li>Improved understanding of color contrast and accessibility.</li>
            <li>Mastered basic gradient techniques with pure CSS.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Specific Challenges:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring color contrast met <strong>accessibility standards</strong>.</li>
            <li>Making themes switch smoothly without breaking the design.</li>
            <li>Generating visually appealing color swatches with <strong>consistent saturation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Potential Improvements:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding <strong>smoother transition effects</strong> for theme switching.</li>
            <li>Testing designs with advanced accessibility tools.</li>
            <li>Experimenting with more complex gradient combinations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <p>
            This exercise gave me a solid understanding of how color impacts web design. I realized that even small adjustments—like tweaking opacity or changing saturation—can drastically improve the visual experience.  
            Using AI for inspiration helped me explore different color schemes when I felt stuck, but fine-tuning the details was all about trial and error.  
            Overall, a <span class="highlight">great learning experience</span> on combining creativity with usability!
