        <h1>Exercise 5: Layout Principles</h1>
    </header>

        <h2>Level 1: Simple Webpage Layout</h2>
        <p>
            In Level 1, I focused on recreating the layout of a simple webpage, inspired by the clean design of a Medium.com article. 
            The goal was to apply consistent margins and padding, using white space effectively to create clear separation between sections. 
            I paid attention to aligning text and images to ensure a seamless reading experience. It was rewarding to see how these fundamental principles
            impacted the overall layout and improved the readability of the content.

        <h2>Level 2: Homepage Design with Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
            For Level 2, I took it a step further and designed a homepage layout with a strong visual hierarchy. The page includes a large hero section, 
            a featured article grid, and a footer. I used larger fonts and bolder colors for important elements to draw attention to them, ensuring they stood 
            out in the layout. Additionally, I added gutters between sections to maintain clarity and prevent the design from feeling cluttered. 
            One of the key takeaways here was applying a CSS grid system to organize content effectively, which made the layout both structured and visually appealing.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to this exercise, and it was a great learning experience. Implementing both the basic layout principles 
            in Level 1 and the more complex visual hierarchy in Level 2 helped reinforce my understanding of effective web design. This exercise truly helped me realize 
            how important it is to use layout techniques thoughtfully to create an engaging and user-friendly webpage.
